In This Assignment, we have to create a 3D model and using mouse we should be able to zoom and rotate it.

Steps to compile and run::

1.> lowpolybunny.obj file and main.cpp both must be in same folder.
2.> run the command:: g++ main.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut (use g++ only, in my laptop for this gcc doesn't work but you can try to run it using gcc)
3.> Then type:: ./a.out and click Enter Key
